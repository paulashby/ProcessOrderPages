  ## Description

  Order management module for the [Processwire](https://processwire.com) Content Management System. Allows registered users to place orders on the front end and site managers to process these on a dedicated admin page.
  
  ## Installation
  
  Firstly, download and install the latest version of [Processwire](https://processwire.com). Download the ProcessOrderPages folder and place in your /site/modules directory. You'll also need do the same with the [OrderCart](https://github.com/paulashby/OrderCart) and [PageMaker](https://github.com/paulashby/PageMaker) modules as these are required by ProcessOrderPages. Please see the OrderCart repository for more information regarding settings.<br /><br />Log into your site as an admin and go the Modules page. Select the Site tab and click the Install button on the ProcessOrderPages module entry.<br /><br />You can now configure the following:
  - **Installation Root** - where on your system you want the module to create its page tree (this is where the module will generate parent pages for Cart Items, Pending Orders, Active Orders and Completed Orders).
  - **Order admin email** - the address you want to use to receive order notifications.
  - **Next order** - the order number you would like to start from. This will be incremented for each new order.
  - **Price page reference field** - in case product pages include a page reference field pointing to a price category. If a simple numerical price field is used, leave this blank.
  - **Name of sku field** - as used by your product page.
  - **Prefix for fields and templates** - useful to avoid naming collisions on files generated by the module.
  - **Roles** - a comma separated list of user roles with access to the Order page
  
  ## Usage
  
  Log into the back end of your site and go to the Orders admin page. Here you can view a list of pending orders and set their status as processed and ultimately completed.
